## Introduction

- Your ability to execute matters more than the idea itself.
- Focus on VC and Angel Investors who have invested in your industry.
  - Focusing on Tech, high scale, and high growth companies.
- Leverage a linkedin network to find investors and connections.
  - Add everyone you know and browse their connections.
  - Use the search bar to find investors in your industry.
  - Use the "People Also Viewed" section to find more investors.
  - Use AngelList to check if they are open to new investments.
  - Ask for a warm introduction, most investors will not respond to cold emails.
- Share deck with a link, not as an attachment or PDF and never send a PPT.
- Attend startup events and pitch competitions. Start befriending people to expand your network.
- Cold emails should be last resort, but if you do, keep it short and to the point.
- Always follow up, but don't be annoying.
- Always be prepared to answer questions about your business.
- Create an Excel sheet to keep track of your progress, every connection, every conversation, and the status.

If most investors are saying that you are too early, then you are too early. Take it, ask if they would like to stay posted on your traction. Stop wasting time on meetings and focus on product traction.

If they agree to stay posted, then send them a monthly update on your traction. If they don't, then move on. It is very important to keep the contact alive and active.

Seed and Pre-seed funding is typically handled using Convertible Notes or SAFEs. These are debt instruments that convert to equity at a later date. They are used to avoid the valuation discussion at the early stages. **STAY AWAY FROM EQUITY AT THIS STAGE**.
