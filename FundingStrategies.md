## Licensing Funding Strategy for Early-Stage Tech Startups

### Executive Summary

The licensing funding strategy for early-stage tech startups aims to leverage the potential of the product's intellectual property to raise capital and build a network of early adopters and distributors. This strategy offers a unique opportunity for tech enthusiasts, industry professionals, and businesses to become early adopters of the product and potentially gain distributorship rights.
