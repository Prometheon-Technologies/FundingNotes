## Core Elements of Pricing

- champion: The customer who is most excited about your product or service and is willing to advocate for you within their organization.

1. The Value Equation: The value equation is the relationship between the price of your product or service and the value it provides to your customers. You need to make sure your price is in line with the value you provide.
    - Sit down with your champion and write down the expected value of your product or service. This will help you understand how much your product or service is worth to your customers. Be clear on the impact your product or service will have on their business.
    - Get the customer to challenge this and prod the claimed value. This will help the champion bring your product or service to the rest of the organization with confidence.
    - normally the value a company cares about is saving time, costs, or increasing revenue.
    - Price yourself at 25% - 50% of the value that you are delivering.
    - Ex: Customer A has $50k in salaries and $50k in other costs. $100k all in per employee. There are 100 employees, that is $10 mil in costs.
    Lets say we can save 20% of the costs. That is $2 mil in savings. They keep roughly 2/3 of those savings, you keep a third of those savings. They keep $1.3 mil, you keep $700k. You can charge $700k for your product.
    - This gives you the success metrics that you need to pilot the project. You can adjust the pricing based on the real value added during a 1 month or more pilot on say 10 employees. This will give you the real value added and you can adjust the pricing accordingly. This equation gives you the success metrics that you need to prove during the pilot process.
    - If you stop here, you'll get 80 - 90% of the pricing spot on.
2. Cost: What does it cost you to provide this service to the customer. This is the minimum price you can charge. Never start with cost, always start with value. Cost should always be a floor.
    - Ex: $700k of revenue, $200k of costs, $500k of profit. This is a 71% profit margin. However if your revenue is $150k, your costs are $200k, you are losing $50k. This is a 33% loss margin. You will either have to demonstrate how you can add more value or change what you are building. Software margins should be between 80% and 90%. Hardware margins should be between 50% and 60%, ideally.
    - You can take a VERY big risk and price yourself lower with the hope or knowledge that you your market will increase with time. This is a very risky strategy and should be avoided if possible. However, it does work for some companies.
3. Competition: Do not get into a bidding war for a head-to-head product. Competing soley on pricing is too risky and will aritificially undervalue your service. You need to be able to differentiate yourself from your competition. The strongest strategy is to show that you are better than your competition by showing that you are worth the price you are charging.
    - Ex: You are a software company that is charging $700k for your product. Your competition is charging $500k for their product. You need to be able to show that you are worth the extra $200k. You can do this by showing that you are more reliable, have better customer service, or have more features. You need to be able to show that you are worth the extra money.
